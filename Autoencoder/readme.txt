This is a project related to the Autoencoder.
It includes thress types such as AGN/MNA/VAE.

"Autoencoder.ipynb" is the ipython file of the 
project,you can run it in you jupyter notebok.

"AGN_Autoencoder.py" is the code of the AGN.
"MNA_Autoencoder.py" is the code of the MAN.
"VAE_Autoencoder.py" is the code of the VAE.

The direction of the "test_result" is the test result.
You can generate it by running in the Autoencoder.ipynb.

The direction of the "MNIST_data" is the origial dataset.
It includes the tarin and test dataset.
You can tar it and compare them to the result.

The direction pf the "CLASS" include the class of the AGN/MNA/VAE.

Take care:
	1) You should remove the annotations to the related situation.
	2) This is project is created by "tensorlfow1.0.1",if you use 
	the old version,it will happen some problem!!
	
	(1) (old)tf.pack() ----> (new)tf.stack()
	(2) (old)tf.scalar_summary() ----> (new)tf.summary_scalar()
	(3) (old)tf.mul() ----> (new)tf.multiply()
	(4) (old)tf.sub() ----> (new)tf.subtract()
	 
	3) It will arise "SYSTE"
